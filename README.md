# Cloudmesh CLI and REST access to Databases


:o: this read me is incomplete

## Motivation

* Understand the construction of REST APIs, and Open API
* Study and Implement microservice architecture 
* Study HTTP performance tools that exist - including some that are cloud based, and some non-cloud based.
* Implement a test driven approach

## Objective

* In the CloudMesh/CMD5 CLI, develop a set of REDSHIFT commands, and commands specific to databases, like REDSHIFT. Examples could to CLUSTER CREATE, CLUSTER DELETE, CLUSTER DESCRIBE, 
* Develop corresponding REST APIs using OpenAPI
* It is demonstarted using redshift

## What is redshift

:o: reword the section in proper sections e.g. no questions, so that it does not look like an FAQ

## How is it different or the same to other databases

## How do I get an AWS account

see our manual, you do not have to develop, find link

## Command line interface

### How do I set up a database with cms

provide a concrete example hwhile using your functions

### How do I add a schema for the database or modify one

### How do I add data to the database

### How do I conduct queries
